<h3>
  <b>Nerd Games</b>
</h3>

Here are some games I developed for fun, for myself and fellow nerds.

<h3>
  <b>Flash Games</b>
</h3>

I developed these flash games as an entry point to programming back in 2013. I
coded everything from scratch and painted the pixelized graphics myself. You can
go over to
<a href="http://flashplayer.fullstacks.net/"
  >http://flashplayer.fullstacks.net/</a
>
to upload and play the .swf games, but only Tower Defense works properly.

<h3>
  <b>Powerpets Games</b>
</h3>

These are games I developed for
<a href="http://www.powerpets.com/">Powerpets</a>, an awesome virtual pet site
which has 200+ daily active players.

<h3>
  <b>Powerpoint Games</b>
</h3>

Before I discovered the magic of coding, I have always been curious about
creating interactive programs with the computer. Here are some games I made in
MS Powerpoint.
