Hi, I'm Tiffany Chong. I write about my mini projects and about things I learn. This blog is mainly about coding, animation, math, but I will write about other stuff I find fascinating like science & philosophy.


If you're curious to know more about me and see stuff I create, you can visit my website <a href="/">here</a>.
