    I have always loved solving math problems and puzzles, so I naturally
    loved coding.
    Programming is an avenue for me to meet the needs
    of the society while doing what I love most.

    <h5>Game Development</h5>

    I started coding in 2013 inspired by the book,
    <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/">
    Invent Your Own Computer Games in Python by Al Sweigart</a>

    and have since then created a lot of

    <b>Graphic Design</b>
</h2>

Vibrant

emulate this in the

I design. I have worked on many projects and several clients
clients such as volunteer welfare organisations.
