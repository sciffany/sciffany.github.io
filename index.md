    I have always loved solving math problems and puzzles, as well as building 
    and creating things, so I naturally
    loved coding.
    Coding is an opportunity for me to contribute 
    to the society while doing what I love most.

    I began coding in 2013
    inspired by the book,
    <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/">
    Invent Your Own Computer Games in Python by Al Sweigart</a>

    and have since then developed several  <a href="/games/">
        <b>games</b></a>.

    <b>Graphic Design</b>
</h2>

Vibrant
colors and bouncy animations of cartoons have always inspired me, and I strive to
emulate this in the
<a href="graphics">
<b>graphics</b>
</a>
I design. I have worked on many projects and several
clients including volunteer welfare organisations.
