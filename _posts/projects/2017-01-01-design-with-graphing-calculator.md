I designed this as an entry to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/designwithgccompetition/"><b>Designing with TI-84+ series</b></a> competition, with the theme: FIFA World Cup

<b>Challenge</b>:

- Discovering what polar equations were and how to draw stars from them.

```

I. Soccer Ball:
(xmin = -17, xmax = 17, ymin = -15, ymax=17, θMin = 0, θmax = 2π)
r1= ((sin2θ)+8) x .5 for the slanted ball effect
r2 = {.2,.3,.4,.5,.6,.7} x (-cos{2.5θ} x.4|+2) for the shaded pentagon
r3 = -|cos1.25θ|x 10 +10 for the 5 lines in the ball
r4 = r3/(r3/r4) to limit the lines

II. Net:
(Tmax=10, Tmin = 0, xmin=-2, xmax=8,ymin=-8.5,ymax=1.5)
Xt = sin(4T)
Yt=1.25sin(9T)

III. Background:
(xmax = -10, xmin = 10, ymin = -10, ymax = 10)
y1= 1.5sin|sin(1.5x+3)|+8/(x>-4) line through the top of the head and arms of audience
y2= 1.2sin(1.5x)+7/(x>-3) line through bottom of the head and arms of audience
y3=2.5sin(1.5X)+9 sine wave for mouths of audience
y4=y3/(y3<7.2)/(x>-3) to limit the sine wave to smiley mouths
y5 = -5.7sin(1.5X)+3 sine wave for eyes of the audience
y6=y5/(y5>7.7)/(y5<8.5)/(x>-3)  to limit the sine waves to dots
y7=-.02x^2 +5.6/(x<-6.5 or x>8) for the hill

IV. Each three soccer player is made of one set of curves (sine, cosine, log, exponential, quadratic and cubic equations) Because there are too many, I’ll just mention the graphs for the drawing of one of the players. The other two also have their own sets.
Bottom-right kicker:
(xmin = -10, xmax = 30, ymin = -15, ymax = 25)

y1 = -|cos(.7x+3.5)|/5x+21 / (x<-2.8)/(x<9)
y2 = .7sin(.6x)-2/(x>-1)/(x>10)
y3=(-.12(x-1)^3 -.15(x-1)^2+.6(x-1)+.5/((x>3.2 and (x<3.8))or((x>4.45)and (x<5.5)))
y4 = 11/(x-1.2)-11/(x>2.7)/(x<5.2)
y5=(-1/(x+3)_.6x+6)/(x>-2.2)/(x<18)
y6= 1.5sin(x-3.5)-1(x>-8)/(x-2)
y7=(-1/(x+4)+.6x+8)/(x>-3)/(x<19)
y8=-6log(x+7)-3>(x<10)
y9=(x+3)^2 -3/3/(x>-4)/(x<-1.2)
y0=-6log(x+8)-5/(x<11)



```
