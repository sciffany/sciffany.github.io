A Java-based flash card management system that allows students
to study for their exams and helps people memorise things

**Key Features:** Deck management which allows categorisation of cards and functionality to export deck for sharing

**My Role:** Developed **Study Sessions** feature where users can:

- See algorithmically generated questions and then subsequently see respective answers
- Type in their answers and compare their answers to actual answer
- Rate the difficulty of cards so that algorithms can be made to optimise learning
