Conducted neuroscience research to analyse trends in subjectâ€™s brain electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during affective picture viewing

**Methodology**

- C application connected to EEG to survey participant emotion while collecting brain data
- Fast Fourier to compute trends in frequency and power features
- ANOVA to train models to classify images based on EEG signal features

**Conclusion**

- Conclusion participants with higher alpha-beta frequency power ratio tend to elicit a higher
  arousal emotion
