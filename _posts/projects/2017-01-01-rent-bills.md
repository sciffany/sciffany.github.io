<a href="https://github.com/sciffany/rent-bills"><b>Rent Bills</b></a> is a Rails web application I designed and developed to help homeowners to monitor tenant debit and credit balance, currently deployed as a <a href="http://rent-bills.herokuapp.com/"><b>Heroku App</b></a> and being used by a handful of clients.

<b>Key Features</b>:

- Access for delegated keepers to help owner input payments
- Two-column records for debit and credit balance for every tenant
- Set different monthly due dates for different tenants
- Dashboards to monitor tenant balance in different locations
