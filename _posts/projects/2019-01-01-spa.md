Developing a <b>static program analyser</b>, which parses a program and analyses which lines
modify, affects, and uses other lines in the program.

<b>My Role:</b>

- To implement a program knowledge base which stores and indexes all information about a single program,
  and can be easily queried for information such as whether a certain abstract syntax tree is present,
  or whether certain lnes are affected by certain variable assignments.
